Description
=============

#### - t-SNE for graph nodes neighbors
  - t-SNE learns a two-dimensional embedding vector that preserves a certain neighboring structure of data represented as a high-dimensional vector, and expresses high-dimensional data as a two-dimensional map.
  - We add two py files (get_neighbor_index.py, select_feature.py) to get neighbors index list of target node and select embedding vector appropriated for index list.
  - Plot the x-axis and y-axis of t-SNE classified labels
